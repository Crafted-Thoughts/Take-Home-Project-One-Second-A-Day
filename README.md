# One Second A Day
In this project, you will be designing a simple app for [1 second video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQxAYAo6sn4). The app is used by people who like to maintain a video journal. 

The idea is very similar to an app called [Daily Snap](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-snap-video-diary/id1208338212). You can find it on the App Store to get a better understanding of the app idea. 


## Tool? Figma
We highly recommend to use Figma. Indeed, we use Figma at Crafted Thoughts. However, you are allowed to use any other tools of your choice (Sketch, Adobe XD, etc) for this project.  

## Inspiration
We recommend looking at our [current apps](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/amogh-joshi/id1360257372) & [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) to find design inspiration. 

[Journal X](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/journal-x-diary-with-lock/id1360257373) and [Timesheet X](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timesheet-x-track-work-hours/id1466196878) are really well designed apps and it will help you to make designs consistent with our app’s design. 

**Moreover, please refer to [Daily Snap](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-snap-video-diary/id1208338212) to understand the app idea only. It is a common mistake to make a clone of Daily Snap or some other competior with little tweeks **

## Requirements 
You just need to design a camera, calendar, and combine features. You may decide to mix all three of them into one single screen or have separate screens for each of them. It’s totally up to you on how you plan to implement the UI/UX of One Second a Day.

### Camera
The app opens with a camera screen like SnapChat where users can record 1 second video. Once the video is recorded, it is added to some collections. 

### Calendar
It is the collection of the recordings users have made. It should intuitively show all the recordings in the form of a calendar.

### Combine.
It is a feature which can combine all the recording into one single video.

## Finished? :clap: 
You speed runner, aren't you?
